Package: async
Title: Asynchronous Computation and 'I/O'
Version: 0.0.0.9003
Author: G치bor Cs치rdi
Maintainer: G치bor Cs치rdi <csardi.gabor@gmail.com>
Description: The 'async' package brings asynchronous ('async') computation
    and 'I/O' to 'R'. It uses an event loop to schedule asynchronous
    functions that report their results via deferred values. Deferred
    values can be chained together for complex async computation, and they
    are evaluated lazily, at synchronisation points.
