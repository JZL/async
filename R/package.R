#' Asynchronous HTTP
#'
#' The `async` package brings asynchronous computation to R.
#' Currently it supports asynchronous HTTP operations, and timers.
#' (Other primitive asynch operations will be added in the future.)
#'
#' @section Async Functions:
#'
#' Asynchronous computation happens in special functions called tasks.
#' A task is a function that reports its completion asynchronously, via
#' calling a callback function.

#' @section List iterators:
#'
#' The package also provides several utilities to make it easier to
#' program with tasks and avoid deeply nested callbacks.
